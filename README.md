### 👋 About Me
I’m a **BSc (Hons) Computing undergraduate** with a growing interest in **core software engineering** — especially how computers actually work under the hood.

Right now, I’m focused on building **strong fundamentals** that matter for (still very much a newbie if ever there was) :
- high-performance systems (C++)
- core low-level / embedded software
- future paths like quantitative or aerospace software

I’m early in the journey, but intentional about what I learn and why.

---

### 🧠 Current Focus
- Writing **modern C++** and understanding what the compiler and memory are really doing  
- Strengthening **data structures & algorithms**
- Learning **operating system concepts** from a systems-programmer point of view  
  (processes, memory, concurrency — not just theory)
- Rebuilding **math foundations** useful for engineering and performance-critical software

---

### 🛠️ Core Skills
**Languages**
- Java  
- C++  
- Python  

**Foundations I’m Actively Working On**
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Memory & performance basics  
- Linux & command-line workflows  
- How software interacts with hardware (at a beginner level)
